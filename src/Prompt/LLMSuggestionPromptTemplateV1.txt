# Few-shot Examples

## Example 1: Git Scenario

  "installedModules": ["git"],
  "lastCommandOutput": "Files staged for commit",
  "commandExecutionTime": "2s",
  "commandFrequency": {"git status": 3, "git add .": 2},
  "commandParametersUsed": ["--all"],
  "sessionDuration": "15m",
  "clipboardContents": "",
}
```

Output 1:
```json
[
  {
    "command": ["git", "commit", "-m", "Update project files"],

    "confidence": 0.95
  },
  {
    "command": ["git", "log", "--oneline"],
    "description": "Shows recent commits. Useful for reviewing history before pushing.",
    "confidence": 0.85
  },
  ...
]
```

## Example 2: Azure CLI Scenario

Input 2:
```json
{
  "previousCommands": ["az login", "az group create --name myGroup"],
  "currentDirectory": "C:\\Infra\\Azure",
  "directoryContents": ["main.tf", "deploy.ps1"],
  "installedModules": ["az"],
  "lastCommandOutput": "Resource group created",
  "commandExecutionTime": "5s",
  "commandFrequency": {"az login": 1, "az group create": 1},
  "commandParametersUsed": ["--name"],
  "sessionDuration": "10m",
  "clipboardContents": "",
}
```

Output 2:
```json
[
  {
    "command": ["az", "vm", "create", "--resource-group", "myGroup", "--name", "myVM", "--image", "UbuntuLTS"],
    "description": "Creates a VM in the newly created resource group. Logical next step.",
    "confidence": 0.92
  },
  {
    "command": ["az", "group", "list"],
    "description": "Lists all resource groups. Useful for verifying creation.",
    "confidence": 0.80
  },
  ...
]
```

# Rules
- Only suggest commands that are valid for the tools listed in installedModules. Do not invent commands for tools that are not present.
- Confidence should reflect how likely the user is to run this command next, based on context.
- Try to include a mix of action, diagnostic, and exploratory commands.
- If context is insufficient, suggest safe and commonly used commands.
- Avoid suggesting commands that could delete files, modify system settings, or perform irreversible actions unless clearly indicated by context.
- You must Escape any double quotes inside arguments as \" so the JSON remains valid like this `Update \"ABC\" project files"`.

# Your Task
Using the context provided below, generate 5 PowerShell command suggestions.
```
{{input context placeholder}}
